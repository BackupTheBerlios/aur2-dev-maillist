The strategies I'm familiar with have pretty much been discussed  
already. If you use topic branches, once the commits are merged into  
the upstream master branch, you could simply delete the topic branch  
and pull changes from upstream into master.

I don't think having a &quot;working&quot; branch is strictly necessary. It  
should be possible to use the master branch as your &quot;working&quot; branch,  
and just `git rebase -i upstream/master` when new commits come in.  
This should put your changes on top of the upstream changes. Of course  
attention should be payed as to which commits are getting rebased.

As for send-mail vs pull request, I don't mind either way. Sending  
patch mails is good for review purposes, as Laszlo pointed out, but  
pull requests are actually easier for developers. Some information is  
lost in patches, such as which commit the patch is based on. Using  
github makes the process even easier, since there's a &quot;pull request&quot;  
feature, and a &quot;fork&quot; tab, allowing to integrate through a web  
interface.

Please do send patches to the list so that they can be peer-reviewed.  
If you wish to send a pull-request you can do that also.
