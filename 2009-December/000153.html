Hello,

1) It was related to my previous patch, so I didn't understand why you
wanted to take this patch instead of suggesting me to correct it, I
didn't take your patches, but I did you some hint earlier, and others
too, so I don't understand this habbit.

2) 1-2 line was different in my patch maybe, if it wasn't the same, I
can't remember well, because I've done more patches in these days, and
It's not my purpose to talking about one patch more days instead of
developing the project efficiently.

3) Did you see the date of patch ?

4) I've applied one of your patch yesterday without any problem(and
earlier more), interesting :)

5) Once more time, I did a patch, you advised something, I kept your
suggestion (it means you gave good suggestion to my patch!) and you
complain about it why I kept your suggestion, and you sent a patch 1-2
days later. Well, I can do patch for everybody who did a not 100 %
good patch instead of suggestions, but first of all it's not correct
or fair, secondly it's not a general git and project development
workflow.

4) The only thing I see in this momment you've got so much problem
with git general, this project handling. I tried to reach you in
private without result to talk about some things, that's not okay for
you or me to clarify it, or to find a good solution for us to make the
situation better, but you didn't reply :(

Best Regards,
Laszlo Papp
