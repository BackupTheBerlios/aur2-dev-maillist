    Fix added date on Package and Comment models
    
    The added datetime for Packages and Comments was getting set in the
    default value (always the datetime from server start), now using
    auto_now_create and auto_now for updated

    Refactor AurRegistrationForm handling
    
    This implementation reduces the dependencies, it means we could change only the
    label, and not worry about anything else. It can happen when the
    django-registration author changes the, or any other setting, inherit the
    django-registration definition of password2, then change it on object
    instanciation. This means the deletion of global variable 'attrs_dict' too.
    
    Summary: The label is edited only, It's pretty safe unless the Forms api gets
    altered significantly.

    Move AurRegistrationFrom subclass handling into the aurprofile
    
    It was needed because the AUR2 Registration Form is more or less profile related
    thing, so it should be placed in the aurprofile app, all the importation was
    moved, RegistrationFormUniqueEmail and ugettext handling too.
    
    The entry in the urls.py was needed to modify to according to the aur ->
    aurprofile chaning

    Add cache related settings into the MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES block
    
    This addition can be found in the official documentation to work, so it was
    needed to add, because the cache facility use those ones for the operation.

    This implementation means a cache middleware one, whole page caching facility,
    but maybe in the future the model level caching is worth to consider or the

Subject: [aur2-dev] temporary MEDIA_ROOT
Message-ID: <4b14952d.9453f10a.2033.ffffefa2@mx.google.com>

There's only one problem with that patch.  Django evaluates settings
twice.  Two temporary directories are created while running tests.
That may not be much of a problem, since both are removed on exit.

Hmm, it's kind of a hack (mainly the use of sys.argv). It's a great  
idea to isolate the test environment like this, but I think a better  
solution is in order. I'm considering implementing something like  
FakeFS (Ruby) in python, to mock the filesystem for the tests. This  
should suffice for the time being (assuming it works :P) though.  
Thanks. It's nice to see the test suite getting some attention :).

Yes it is a hack.  I ran across this idea somewhere on the net, while
looking at info about Django testing.
The FakeFS concept sounds nice.

Hello,

1) It was related to my previous patch, so I didn't understand why you
wanted to take this patch instead of suggesting me to correct it, I
didn't take your patches, but I did you some hint earlier, and others
too, so I don't understand this habbit.

2) 1-2 line was different in my patch maybe, if it wasn't the same, I
can't remember well, because I've done more patches in these days, and
It's not my purpose to talking about one patch more days instead of
developing the project efficiently.

3) Did you see the date of patch ?

4) I've applied one of your patch yesterday without any problem(and
earlier more), interesting :)

5) Once more time, I did a patch, you advised something, I kept your
suggestion (it means you gave good suggestion to my patch!) and you
complain about it why I kept your suggestion, and you sent a patch 1-2
days later. Well, I can do patch for everybody who did a not 100 %
good patch instead of suggestions, but first of all it's not correct
or fair, secondly it's not a general git and project development
workflow.

4) The only thing I see in this momment you've got so much problem
with git general, this project handling. I tried to reach you in
private without result to talk about some things, that's not okay for
you or me to clarify it, or to find a good solution for us to make the
situation better, but you didn't reply :(

Best Regards,
Laszlo Papp

    It also includes support for using a fixed OpenID server endpoint. Launchpad is

    New dependency was established, named django-openid-auth, it can helps with
    their implementation and documentation.
    
    So this dependency was added to the pip-requirements.txt, and the related

    Implement Remember me checkbox to the login page
    
    This is a typical feature on websites, like in case of AUR too, so it was worth
    to implement it. The Remember Me feature allows a user to select a Remember Me,
    checkbox on the website login form.  When checked the user will be "remembered"
    between browser sessions.
    
    The implementation touched the new extended form class, the new view, extended
    login template, and the url too

If appears this won't work. From the Django documentation about  
set_expiry():
> If value is 0, the user?s session cookie will expire when the user?s

You should really test your changes, at least manually, but preferably  
using unit tests. This could have been easily caught.

    Delete AurRegistrationForm reference from settings.py
    
    There is no need for passing this form class in the urls.py, because it's the
    same as the default one.
    
    The aurprofile.forms import was deleted too from urls.py, because it's not used

    Change the session expiration data from 0 to ~ 1 year
    
    The only requirement was here not to be 0, because it will expire automatically
    when the browser is closed, so one year period was choosed, which should be
    enough for it here.

I saw it in an example (django-remember_me module ?).
Otherwise you're right with this recommandation, Sebastian. Corrected, thanks.

I installed django_openid_auth, but that doesn't seem sufficient.
A dependency is missing.  I believe it is python-openid.
Here's what I get when I run
python manage.py test

  File "build/bdist.linux-i686/egg/django_openid_auth/tests/test_store.py", line 5, in <module>
ImportError: No module named openid.association

And here's a fragment of what "manage.py test aur" gives:

  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/django/contrib/auth/__init__.py", line 15, in load_backend
    raise ImproperlyConfigured, 'Error importing authentication backend %s: "%s"' % (module, e)
ImproperlyConfigured: Error importing authentication backend django_openid_auth.auth: "No module named openid.consumer.consumer"

Yeah, you're right Chris, the problem appeared by me too on server of
AUR2, I installed python-openid, and it solved the issue. Maybe it
would be better to add it into the dependecies of django-openid-auth
package on AUR(not to the AUR2 project), but I didn't have time to
submit it yesterday. Now I submitted the modified django-openid-auth
package, and I've adopted the dependency, python-openid. This will
make pacman bring it in

Otherwise to patch setup.py would be nice so that the dependency is
there (this, when updated, makes pip and easy_install bring in
python-openid).

Thanks your feedback once more time.

    Implement RSS facility for newly updated/added packages
    
    This is similar that can be seen on so much site, like current AUR too.
    
    Implementation details:
    
    * New Feed class was established and therefore a new file too, aur/feeds.py
    * New entry was added in the urls.py to it, and a new feed element
    * The search template was modified in extra_head block regard, new link was
    * added with the related /feeds/rss url in a link

    Redirect accounts/login/ while logged in
    
    When a logged in user tried to load the accounts/login/ page, the real login
    form was got meanwhile the actual user was logged in, so this was a small bug.
    
    The solution was for it to redirect that page in this case to the 'aur-main'
    one, which means the search page. So this redirections happens when the
    user authentication is ok.

    Refactor middleware implementation in the settings.py, fix cache problems
    
    Issues were:
    
    * The problem was the earlier logged in user could be seen after trying to log in.
    * After clicking for the 'Packages' submenu the actual logged in user couldn't
    be seen
    
    The problem was the cache handling, the fix for it was to change the previous
    cache middleware for:
    
    * UpdateCacheMiddleware, in the beginning of the middleware order list
    * FetchFromCacheMiddleware, at the end of middleware order list
    
    The documentation says why they should occur at the beginning/end of the
    middleware section.

    Change the rss feed to display the last 20 packages instead of all
    
    It was more reasonable to see the last 20 newly updated/added packages in the

    packages. 20 was choosen, because the current AUR implementation works so too.

    It's good to know about a user when he or she registered and later it can be

    The implementation touched the aurprofile/profile.html template file, it was
    needed to insert a new line into the profile form, with the builtind user
    date_joined option with the real date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

commit 06e0d740ac3fe31aadcfe7ec887eb0addb76c704
Author: Laszlo Papp <djszapi at archlinux.us>
Date:   Wed Dec 9 00:36:15 2009 +0100

    Implement /users/$username/packages url showing given user packages
    
    This feature isn't implemented in the last format, it's just a very pure and
    starting implementation for it that should be continued in the near future.
    
    The packages from the desired user will be available for other users to see, and
    check them.
    
    The implementation is simple here, one url addition is needed for it, and to do
    the template html for it, named templates/aur/package_list.html

    Add a warning message for trying to see user details without logging in
    
    It's needed to implement as long it's implemented on the current AUR too.
    So any trying to see the user details page as an anonymous user without logging
    it, it won't work.
    
    The implementation happened only in the desired template file, named

    Implement automatic new account adding to User group
    
    The new users are automatically added to the default 'User' group after this
    feature implementation. In case of more than 1000-1500 users it can be very
    handy and comfortable :)
    
    The implementation touched:
    
    * aur/forms.py -> New AddGroupDefaultBackend subclass implementation as a
    wrapper for the DefaultBackend of registration module, it was needed because the
    register method should be overwritten with automatically adding the new accounts
    into the defined 'User' group
    
    * urls.py -> The DefaultBackend reference was changed for the newly created
    AddGroupDefaultBackend url.

    Implement User Details page as /users/$username
    
    It was a sense feature to implement, it can be seen on the current AUR too, when
    you click for a username after you logged in.
    
    The implementation touched the followings:
    
    * The urls.py file, where object_details generic view was used with slug effect
    * Establish the templates/aurprofile/user_detail.html related template file with
    the users data, like lastname, firstname, username, registered date, email,
    account type
    
    Small remark: It's worth to redesign with css this page, because now it's very
    pure.

I haven't had time to look at the commit diff, but how does this  
differ from the list of packages on the user profile? Apart from it  
being a separate page, of course.

The urls.py changes should in in aurprofile/urls.py, not the archlinux/ 
urls.py. It should also be under the URL /profile/, not /users/, for  
consistency.

The @login_required decorator should be used here (it redirects to the  
login page - much more useful than a simple warning message). Don't  
just attempt to just replicate AUR functionality, attempt to improve  
upon it.

Cool. The current aurprofile template should be re-used somehow. It  
should display information about the user if the profile is not the  
user's, otherwise it should also allow editing of that information  
(like it does now).

    Implement 'View this user's packages' link in the user_detail.html template
    
    This feature/link was implemented earlier in the current AUR too, so this one
    has got a compatibility reason too first of all, secondly it provides the
    facility to other users to see the packages from this desired user easily with a
    quick link
    
    The implementation was just to add a div with the link of the desired user's
    packages.

    Add 'Recent Updates' + RSS logo on the search page
    
    The RSS page for newly updated/added packages was established earlier, but there
    weren't an available link for them apart from Mozilla Firefox builtin button or
    typing the link manually, so this feature first of all made sense, and secondly
    it's implemented on the current AUR, so it has got a compability reason too

    Add 'My Packages' submenu
    
    This feature was implemented on the current AUR and it's an efficient facility
    to view your own packages quickly, so it was worth to implement and it wasn't a
    big deal, it was needed to modify the base.html template, to add this new
    submenu and to implement the right url, with right parameters(username) for it.

    Add user's language preference with /i18n/setlang
    
    As a convenience, Django comes with a view, django.views.i18n.set_language,
    that sets a user???s language preference and redirects back to the previous page.
    
    Activate this view by adding the following line to your URLconf:
    (r'^i18n/', include('django.conf.urls.i18n')),
    (Note that this example makes the view available at /i18n/setlang/.)

The placement of the header is slightly confusing. Since the "Search  
Criteria" header is right-aligned, it looks like "Recent Updates" is  
the header of the page (it's also the same level, which shouldn't be  
the case). Removing "Recent Updates" and placing the RSS icon to the  
right would be better, but it would imply that the RSS feed is of the  
search, rather than recent updates. Like I said in our conversation  
there's no good place to put this at the moment. I'd probably put it  
somewhere in the footer, but we don't really have a footer. Using a  
browser's in-built RSS capabilities should be enough for now. It's not  
just a Mozilla Firefox feature. All browsers I know of support this,  
including Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari, etc.

This should be in .git/info/excludes, not in .gitignore.  
The .gitignore file should only have files that are generated or would  
otherwise be present, but specific to the project. Patch files  
shouldn't even be used (unless temporarily), as we are using git.

This is already implemented through the use profile page - why  
duplicate it? It's confusing having two ways of seeing your packages.

I'm against having comments at all. It isn't useful for packages  
themselves. There are other, superior, means of communicating with  
package managers and/or discussing packages, e.g.: email, forums, IRC,  
bug tracker.

I don't know whether it would be a good idea to place just one icon at
the right side where the search field is, it sounds interesting, the
current AUR + Main Archlinux site doesn't do so too.
Maybe it's not the best to count for that every browser will have got
builtin feature for it that users use.
Maybe it would be better to implement such an outlook/solution that
the main archlinux site uses in this situation.

I saw *.swp files in other projects and the *.patch related one too,
It doesn't bother me if it's there.

Yeah, I've realised later you choosed another solution for it like AUR
does. It's needed to decide which approach to use, to involve user's
package in the personal profile or not, or a separate menu, because
profile isn't equal to aur related things, that's why aur and
aurprofile is in the different app now.

Discussing AUR packages on IRC/forums/email ? What happens if the
Maintainer doesn't use IRC or forums ?
IRC and forums aren't bug trackers, and there isn't AUR packages
related thread on the bugtracker, which is ok so, I think, it's
unsupported.
Email can make sense, but that one is private conversation, meanwhile
this comment framework is a public one, which is better in this
situation.

I will use javascript later, e.g. in the TU voting app that's nearly
finished, but I don't use messages at this momment, we will see.

    Change 'Repository' column for 'Repo' in the user profile too
    
    It was needed to reduce the size of the column, and it's used so on the
    officical Archlinux page too

    Change 'Repository' column  to 'Repo' on the search page
    
    The reason for it was to reduce to size of the column first of all, secondly to
    follow the official way where 'Repo' is displayed.

    Separate Name and Version instead of Name unit in the search templ.
    
    First of all it makes better sense to handle these two things separately,
    because it's a separate feature of a package, like in case of PKGBUILD too, two
    different lines.
    Secondly the current Main Site handles them so too.
    
    New column was added on the the search page.

    Fix some refenreces for user profiles
    
    It tried to load the logged in user's profile every time, after the /profile ->
    /users changing at this was fixed this time.
    
    The profile view was refactored to handle the username argument and the related
    urls were changed, object_id -> username, in the urls.py files.

Date:   Sun Dec 13 21:08:11 2009 +0100

    Change 'profile/' link for 'users/' in the urls.py
    
    This was needed because the django developers support it better than any custom
    link name here, so the auth app/modules use the default /users name for it, so
    it's more reasonable to use that one then.
    
    The rejection of it can be seen here, with the mail thread too:

Hello

My name is Rodrigo Flores and I am the coordinator of the Brazilian
Portuguese translation team for archlinux related stuff (pacman, wiki
and etc). I want to know about the i18n support and the schedule of
this project. Will you use the gettext files for that ? When we will
be able to translate that ?

Thanks on advance

Hello Rodrigo!

Yes, i18n support will be involved, at least I hope so :)
I will be on 'vacant' soon, because of Christmas and New Years, but I
will take an announcement on this list before the release, so if you
follow the mails here, you will see it.
I won't have internet connection in the next 2-3 weeks, so thanks your
patient, but I will work on it in the 'background' as much as
possible. I wouldn't like to say a roadmap or a dead line for the
release version because it's my hobby only, but I hope the best.

Best Regards,
Laszlo Papp

Hi Laszlo

Thanks for you reply. Do you have an idea of how many strings we will
translate and how many time we will have to do the translation ? I
believe a string freeze period (or a string change announcement
period) should be an excelent way for we to get the things translated
without having the concern to update the po files.

Best regards

I did translation for current AUR, and It didn't take me more than 3-4
hours, but I was/am not an expert in translation, so it would be
smaller job for you, it's sure :) I guess it won't take more than the
current AUR, but we will see, django will our friend in it.

Yes, I think it's Ok.

I need some things to do before this announcement, I wouldn't like to
show a demo release in a hurry, my purpose is to give a correct
release instead with fewer bugs :)
Anyway, thanks all your help, I hope you won't lost your patient :P

I will be 'out of office' from Friday, I won't have internet
connection until January, so I wish you happy holidays, Arch
contributors :o)

It appears the auto_now* attributes have been deprecated in Django 1.0  
(they were actually replaced with the datetime.now() calls  
previously), so I prefer this method. I modified the patch slightly to  
use a callable (default=datetime.now) rather than the save method. The  
changes to Votes were removed, as votes haven't been pushed to master  
yet.

Applied in my repository. Thanks.

You forgot to add media/feed-icon-14x14.png to the repository. What is  
the copyright of the icon?

What's with the dangling AtomLatestPackages class? Why isn't it used?  
Could you finish your changes before pushing them?

The author_* fields are optional and I don't think they are relevant  
(it might be for a blog). They should definitely not have your details.

Shouldn't the item_pubdate return the actual date, as opposed to doing  
nothing? i.e.:
> def item_pudbate(self, pkg):
>     return pkg.updated

Please remove the comments. If you don't want something in the source  
code, then don't add it.

The link should use Django's URL dispatcher.

1. The current comments implementation should be removed, if the  
comments framework is to be used instead.
2. The first two "bugs" you mention are not bugs at all, considering  
they are caused by the change to use the comments framework.
3. The layout is broken and doesn't even resemble the previous one.
4. Please add a proper "comment submitted" template. I'd prefer it the  
current behavior was conserved, i.e. redirect to the package's page.

While I understand the reason to rename the "user" variable, why did  
you rename it to "pkg"? It makes no sense to call a user "pkg." Also,  
as mentioned above, it's only a bug because of your changes to the  
template. It was not a bug previously. This wouldn't be a problem if  
you had tested your changes and didn't push them out so frequently.

Please keep in mind that quality is much more important than quantity.

    It was needed because of the unity, but it's a pure design at this momment too,
    but it matches to the other pages better.
    
    The following tasks will happen in the future:
    * A better css design(similar to the login page)
    * Add OpenID logo

I won't even look at this one as the diff is too noisy. Why did you re- 
indent everything? It's now a level too deep.

I haven't looked at how Django permissions work exactly, but looking  
at the _user_can_delete_package filter, it seems it's dependent on  
package.__unicode__ returning the package name. I think it should use

The last conditional is confusing. It makes me ask the question what  
happens if the user isn't a moderator. It seems it won't return  
anything if the package exists, so the user gets a blank page? The  
conditional should be removed imo. Also the try/except is redundant  
since the get_object_or_404 function already redirects to a 404 error  
page. It is thus guaranteed that the except block will never execute.
